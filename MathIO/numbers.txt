This document has no purpose or meaning. That's why you should keep reading.
Bananas are slightly radioactive because they contain an unstable form of pottasium: K31.
You'd have to eat around 10 million bananas to die from radiation poisoning.
Some extreme banana theorists claim that eating more than a dozen bananas per day
will result in you needing kidney dialysis because of all the potsiium your kidneys are processing.
I can't tell you whether this is bogus or true because this claim has just been 
shot out onto the internet without any scientific research/experiments on test animals.
Now that you've read through this pointless document do you have any thoughts?
How big is the universe you may be asking yourself (probably not). Well there's no definite answer because it gets larger every nano second.
